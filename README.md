App simulating the process of assigning orthogonal codes in CDMA channel access method 

This application's purpouse is to simulate the process of assigning the orthogonal codes/sequences in CDMA (code-division multiple access) method for wireless networks. The algorithm builds the OVSF tree of orthogonal sequences and then assigns them to each one of the 26 possibles users, based on their spreading factor (SF) values, simultaneously blocking the already assigned codes and their ancestors or descendants in tree. Each assigned sequence can be shown by double-clicking the user allocated to OVSF tree branch.
